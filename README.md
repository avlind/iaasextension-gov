# SQL IaaS Agent Extension for Microsoft Azure Government 

This repository is to help provide guidance and scripts on how to bulk register SQL Server Virtual Machines in Azure with the Azure SQL IaaS Agent Extension in Azure Government. To see how to review you can view my [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmB3ufHN9Kk) on running scripts to register your SQL VMs.

The .psm1 script in this repository is the same one used in the video, but comes pre modified:
```
1. Modified to work from Azure Cloud Shell
2. Modified to log into Azure Government
```
